# Childhood Snake game
designed using SFML in c++

You start the game on lvl 1 and you keep going untill you hit yourself or a secion of the wall.
Speed gets higher each time you advance in a lvl or when you eat a delecious apple.

# About the levels
the levels are stored in txt files. 𝒉𝒐𝒘 𝒅𝒐𝒆𝒔 𝒊𝒕 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌?

 The screen is designed to be 800:600 pixles.
 each wall section is 20:20px.
 
 if we devided the size of the wall sections by the width and height we will get 40*30, so that is it! 40 characters and 30 raw in the text file and 𝘽𝘼𝘼𝙈!
 by calcualting the position of the Character X you can put it exactly where you want on the screen.

 # What is coming
1- Texture to the snake and the apple. (instead of those weird blocks)

2- All the necessary text. (right now it is just the game there is not any text)

3- A mode where the user can add his own levels. 
Note: the user can do that now using txt files, but it is going to be a lot better if he was actually able to select
the blocks himself on the screen and then the code will convert it to a TXT file so it can be played.
